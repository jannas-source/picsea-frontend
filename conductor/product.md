# Initial Concept

7Sense is kind of a place holder for now while Mysealium is being built-but review all the knowlege base and Myselium Holding folder for the big picture

# Product Definition: MySealium (fka 7Sense)

## Vision & Concept

**Initial Concept:** 7Sense is currently serving as the operational landing page and brand placeholder for MySealium Holdings. The long-term vision is to build the "Operating System for Marine Vessel Ownership," where every boat has a digital twin and management is driven by integrated intelligence.

## Core Mission

To make boat ownership effortless by building the most intelligent marine procurement and management platform in the world.

## The Problem We Solve

Boat ownership is plagued by fragmentation:

- **Identification:** Finding the right parts is frustrating and error-prone.
- **Verification:** Ordering the wrong part leads to massive labor loss (approx. $500+ per error for dealers).
- **Logistics:** Coordinating between multiple suppliers and service providers is a "second job" for owners.

## Our Solution: The PicSea Engine

PicSea is an end-to-end intelligent procurement platform launching its MVP in Q1 2026, featuring a 7-stage flow:

1. **Multi-Method ID:** Photo, Text, Barcode, and Voice input.
2. **Cross-Check Engine:** Prevents wrong orders through data validation.
3. **Context Gathering:** Integrates vessel profiles and installer experience levels.
4. **Knowledge Query:** Scans manuals and manufacturer best practices.
5. **BOM Generation:** Recommends primary parts plus all necessary consumables (gaskets, lubes).
6. **Procurement Optimization:** Sources primarily through the CWR Distribution partnership.
7. **Digital Twin Update:** Automatically updates the vessel's digital twin upon installation.

## Target Audience

- **Primary (B2B):** Marine dealers, independent technicians, and professional service providers who use the "Certification Tracker" and high-volume procurement.
- **Secondary (B2C):** Individual boat owners seeking "effortless" maintenance and part replacement.

## Success Metrics (3-Year Goal)

- 250,000+ active vessel profiles.
- $15.5M+ ARR.
- Primary AI partnership for the marine electronics industry.
