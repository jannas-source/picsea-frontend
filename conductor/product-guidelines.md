# Product Guidelines: MySealium Design & Voice

## 1. Visual Identity & Design Language

**Philosophy: Modern Marine Utility**
We blend the sophistication of a high-end data platform (Palantir-style) with the practical, high-contrast requirements of the maritime environment.

- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary Background:** Deep Space Navy (#0a0a0f) to minimize glare and maximize contrast.
  - **Accent Colors:** Electric Cyan (#00d9ff) and Safety Seafoam (#4DD4AC) for high-visibility interactive elements.
  - **Status Indicators:** Industry-standard colors (Red for critical, Amber for caution) but integrated into the glassmorphic aesthetic.
- **Typography:**
  - **Font:** 'Inter' for its extreme legibility at small sizes and high pixel density.
  - **Hierarchy:** Strong, bold headlines with light, well-spaced subheaders.
- **Components:**
  - **Glassmorphism:** Use subtle transparency and border-glows to indicate modern "intelligent" layers.
  - **Grid Systems:** Always maintain a structured, data-driven feel using grid lines and technical watermarks.

## 2. Voice and Tone

- **Authoritative but Accessible:** We are the experts (the "Operating System"), but we don't hide behind jargon. We make complex data simple.
- **Urgent & Precise:** In maritime operations, time is money. Our messaging should be concise, active, and focused on immediate action (e.g., "Verify Part" vs "Click here to see if this part is correct").
- **Reliable:** Use language that evokes stability and trust. We emphasize "Cross-Verification" and "Best Practices."

## 3. Product Experience Principles

- **Effortless Procurement:** Every interaction should reduce the "second job" of the owner.
- **Zero-False-Positives:** The PicSea engine prioritizes accuracy above all else to prevent $500 labor losses.
- **Vessel-Centric:** All data and recommendations are filtered through the "Digital Twin" of the specific vessel, ensuring relevance.

## 4. Brand Messaging

- **Tagline:** "Effortless Yachting Through Living Intelligence."
- **Key Value Prop:** "The end of wrong parts and wasted days."
